<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>I am a curious learner who can easily grasp new concepts and adapt to different situations. Alongside my interest in technology and basics of HTML, C, Java, and Data Structures, I enjoy engaging in activities that keep me balanced and creative. Playing outdoor games helps me stay active and develop teamwork skills, while drawing allows me to express creativity. I also enjoy cooking, which enhances my patience, attention to detail, and ability to follow processes.</p>
